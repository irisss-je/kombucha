INGREDIENTS

60 g white cane sugar
2 teabags we love Rooibos or green tea
1 Scoby
180 g kombucha previously brewed or kombucha
1 litre water

INSTRUCTIONS

Pour 1 litr of water into the kettle and boil. Once boiled, add your tea bags of choice along with the sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and the tea bags really give their flavour, this should take about 5 mins. Remove the tea bags and discard.
Leave this liquid to cool ensuring that its below 37 degrees celsius, body temperature (if it is hotter, it will kill the SCOBY)
Add your SCOBY and the cup of previously brewed kombucha into the jar. Cover with a clean teatowel and leave to sit for 10-15 days out of direct sunlight, at room temperature
